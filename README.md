# BubBuy

A simple Unturned selling items module.
this is not Rocket mod plugin, this module which can run on any server.
it is aimed for selling items by server (like vendor NPCs). (not from player to player)

the currency is player experience.

# how to install:

copy the folder BubBuy to `[your Unturned server folder]/Modules`

# how to use:

- admin need to stand close to a wall and use the command `/put_signd [item id]`
then edit the sign to adjust price.
for example: `/put_sign 81`
will add to the wall a sign for selling MRE


- players can buy the item by standing close to the sign and use `/buy` 

- another option is to define a shop at the config file, then admins could easy spawn it after wipes by using /spawn_shop [SHOP_ID]
to see available shops to spawn (by admins) : /list_shops
